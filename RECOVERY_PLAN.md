# Recovery Plan for Matrix Visualization

## Current Situation

After deploying the improved matrix visualization, it appears that other features of the app are no longer functioning correctly. This document outlines the plan to recover the app while preserving the visualization improvements.

## Recovery Steps

1. **Preserve the Improved Visualization**
   - The improved visualization code has been backed up to the `backup-viz` directory
   - These files include the enhanced circular positioning system and overlap prevention logic

2. **Restore the Original App**
   - Use `restore-app.bat` to reset to a known good commit
   - Based on the git history, commit `83c694b` appears to be the last commit before the visualization changes
   - This will restore all original app functionality

3. **Incremental Reintegration**
   - After confirming the app is working properly, create a new branch
   - Reintegrate the visualization improvements in small, testable steps:
     - First, update only the node positioning logic in `use-matrix-positioning.tsx`
     - Test thoroughly
     - Then update the container and SVG viewBox in `matrix-visualization.tsx`
     - Test again
     - Finally, update the node styling and interactions

4. **Testing Checklist**
   - Ensure the form works and submits data
   - Verify all interpretation tabs display correctly
   - Confirm sharing and downloading functions work
   - Test on multiple screen sizes and devices
   - Verify that all nodes are visible and don't overlap

## Lessons Learned

- Make incremental changes rather than complete rewrites
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Consider creating a branch for major feature work
- Preserve a working version before deploying substantial changes

## Restore Command

To restore the original app:

```
cd c:\web\DestinyMatrixAnalyzer
.\restore-app.bat
```

When prompted, enter the commit ID `83c694b` or the appropriate last known good commit.
